# Welcome to the IMprojtech Profile!

Hi! My name is **Mirko Catoni**, and this is my space on GitHub, where I share projects designed to simplify certain tasks that I personally find tedious or repetitive.

## My Projects

The repositories you'll find here are collections of tools and programs that I've created to solve specific problems I've encountered. These projects are **"raw"** â€” meaning they are functional, but developed by me, and I am not a professional. They represent my personal approach to problem-solving and are designed to be useful, though they might not be refined or fully optimized.

## My Philosophy

The idea behind these projects is simple: **share to improve**. I hope these repositories can serve as a starting point or inspiration for others who face similar problems or situations. I would love to see these projects grow and improve with contributions from other users. If you find one of my projects useful or think you can enhance it, you are welcome to contribute!

## Contribute and Collaborate

I am open to collaborations and suggestions. If you have ideas on how to improve one of my projects or if you just want to share your thoughts, feel free to create a pull request or contact me directly. Together, we can turn these "raw" tools into powerful and useful resources for many others.
